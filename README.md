# Financial Fraud Detection System using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project builds a machine learning-based system to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The model learns patterns from historical transaction data and classifies each transaction as **fraudulent or legitimate**.

A Flask-based web application is provided for real-time prediction and visualization.
